# Decibel_Meter
I create a device can measure level of decibel using STM32. This device use 18650 batteries to operate, display on oled 0.96" screen and can measure realtime.
When I restore my computer, STM32's program, schematic and PCB for this project is deleted. So I put the 1st code in arduino and some images about it.
